# Book2Book #

## Midterm Group Project, Skill Distillery, Week Nine ##

Book2Book is peer2peer file sharing for books!  List your own that you're willing to lend, search for a book you haven't read, and lend, borrow, or exchange books all on the same site.  
- Home page includes login and account creation as well as a sample list of available books to borrow.
- Once logged in, users have the option to curate their list of books they wish to lend, request a book to borrow, and search books in our database or add one of their own.
